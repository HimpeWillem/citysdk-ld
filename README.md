# CitySDK LD API v1.0

The CitySDK Linked Data API offers unified and direct access to open transport, mobility and general data from government, commercial and crowd sources alike. It is designed to work closely with other open source projects as OpenTripPlanner, Analyst, Open311 and OpenStreetMap. Based on objects linked to a geometry, the API provides for a linked-data (JSON-LD) view of the added data; one query about one object provides results from multiple datasets, annotated using semantic web technologies. 

This is the working repository for CitySDK LD API v1.0. For more information about the CitySDK LD API, see the [website](http://citysdk.waag.org) or [wiki](../../wiki).
