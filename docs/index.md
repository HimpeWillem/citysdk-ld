This website contains endpoint specific information only, mainly regarding the datasets available here. All general documentation on the API can be found on the wiki at the corresponding [GitHub Wiki]({{ site.data.endpoint.wiki }}).


## GitHub

[GitHub repository]({{ site.data.endpoint.github }}) working repository for CitySDK LD API v1.0. 

[Wiki]({{ site.data.endpoint.wiki }}): documentation on using the API, adding data, installing your own endpoint.

## JSON-LD

[JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) is a lightweight Linked Data format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is based on the already successful JSON format and provides a way to help JSON data interoperate at Web-scale. JSON-LD is an ideal data format for programming environments, REST Web services, and unstructured databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB.

## Swagger

The CitySDK LD API provides its API specification via [Swagger](http://swagger.io/). Please see our [Swagger client]({{ site.baseurl }}/swagger) for detailed information of all API calls.

## Endpoint discovery

A project-wide [Discovery API](cat.citysdk.eu) is available to see which CitySDK APIs are available for which geography/jurisdiction.
