# API key / account

## Read

No API key is needed to read data from this API, see our [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/faq) as well.

## Write

To create your own layer of data, link your data to objects/other data and more you will need an account. To get one send us an [email](mailto:{{ site.data.endpoint.email }}). We aim to reply within two business days.

All Write API requests require authentication by means of a session key, a random string that provides temporary, secure access to the Write API. See the wiki at our [GitHub repository]({{ site.data.endpoint.wiki}}).
